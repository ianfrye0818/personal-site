            I&apos;m a passionate Web Developer who specializes in full stack development using
            technologies like React, NodeJS, Express, and NextJS. I thrive on bringing the technical
            and visual aspects of digital products to life, with a strong focus on user experience,
            pixel-perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code.

          <Typography>
            Since beginning my journey as a web developer in 2023, I have grown and evolved by
            taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies. I&apos;ve built several
            full stack projects with real-world applications, including a kudo sharing app for
            workplaces and a real-time polling app for presentations and general use. I&apos;m eager
            to create more cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as Next.js,
            TypeScript, TailwindCSS, PostgreSQL, and more.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products end to end, from
            ideation all the way to development.
